# Add Applications

Admin Console allows to create, clone, import an application and add it to the environment with its subsequent deployment in Gerrit and building of the Code Review and Build pipelines in Jenkins. 

To add an application, navigate to the **Applications** section on the left-side navigation bar and click the Create button.

Once clicked, the six-step menu will appear: 

* The Codebase Info Menu
* The Application Info Menu
* The Advanced Settings Menu
* The Version Control System Info Menu
* The Exposing Service Info Menu
* The Database Menu

_**NOTE**: The Version Control System Info menu is available in case this option is predefined._

## The Codebase Info Menu

1. In the **Codebase Integration Strategy** field, select the necessary option that is the configuration strategy for the replication with Gerrit:
    - Create – creates a project on the pattern in accordance with an application language, a build tool, and a framework.
    - Clone – clones the indicated repository into EPAM Delivery Platform. While cloning the existing repository, you have to fill in the additional fields as well.
    - Import - allows configuring a replication from the Git server. While importing the existing repository, you have to select the Git server and define the respective path to the repository.
    > _**NOTE**: In order to use the import strategy, make sure to adjust it by following the [Adjust Import Strategy](../documentation/import-strategy.md) page._ 
2. In the **Git Repository URL** field, specify the link to the repository that is to be cloned.
3. Select the **Codebase Authentication** check box and fill in the requested fields:
    - Repository Login – enter your login data.
    - Repository password (or API Token) – enter your password or indicate the API Token.
    
    _**NOTE**: The Codebase Authentication check box should be selected just in case you clone the private repository. If you define the public one, there is no need to enter credentials._ 
4. Click the Proceed button to be switched to the next menu.

    - JavaScript - selecting JavaScript allows using the React framework.
    - .Net - selecting .Net allows using the NET Core framework.
    - Other - selecting Other allows extending the default code languages when creating a codebase with the clone/import strategy. To add another code language, inspect the [Add Other Code Language](add_other_code_language.md) section.

    _**NOTE**: The Create strategy does not allow to customize the default code language set._
    
7. Choose the necessary build tool in the Select Build Tool field:

10. Select CI pipeline provisioner that will be handling a codebase. For details, refer to the [Add Job Provision](https://github.com/epmd-edp/jenkins-operator/blob/master/documentation/add-job-provision.md#add-job-provision) instruction and become familiar with the main steps to add an additional job provisioner.
11. Select Jenkins slave that will be used to handle a codebase. For details, refer to the [Add Jenkins Slave](https://github.com/epmd-edp/jenkins-operator/blob/master/documentation/add-jenkins-slave.md#add-jenkins-slave) instruction and inspect the steps that should be done to add a new Jenkins slave.  
12. Select the necessary codebase versioning type:

Using the default versioning type, in order to specify the version of the current artifacts, images, and tags in the Version Control System, a developer should navigate to the corresponding file and change the version **manually**.
      
     * **edp** - the new versioning logic that is available in EDP Admin Console 2.3.0 and subsequent versions. Using the edp versioning type, a developer indicates the version number from which all the artifacts will be versioned and, as a result, **automatically** registered in the corresponding file (e.g. pom.xml). 
     
       When selecting the edp versioning type, the extra field will appear:
