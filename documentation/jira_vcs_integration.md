2. Each project in Gerrit should be integrated with project in [Crucible](https://crucible.epam.com/), by creating a request in [Support](https://support.epam.com/), example of request:

    ![request_example](../readme-resource/—Årucible_integration_request.png "request_example")  

3. To link commits with Jira ticket, in commit message set ticket ID following a specific format:
